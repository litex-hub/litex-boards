# Pin assignment consistent with MPSSE Channel A, Table 3.14 for FT4232H-56Q
#  ADBUS0 (pin 12) USB_TCK
#  ADBUS1 (pin 13) USB_TDI
#  ADBUS2 (pin 14) USB_TDO
#  ADBUS3 (pin 15) USB_TMS
# Additional pin, GPIOL0, set high
#  ADBUS4 (pin 17) EN_USB_JTAG
# check logic of EN_USB_JTAG:
#  routed to U39-3 P0_2 for informational purposes
#  also to Q5, forces disable of Self_FPGA_* buffers
